# Kata Pencil
Accenture Coding Kata that accurately simulate the functions of a pencil as defined at https://github.com/PillarTechnology/kata-pencil-durability. 

The purpose of this is to demonstrate Test Driven Development (TDD) by starting with the unit tests and then creating the necessary commponents to make the test pass. This was not always followed strictly in that order because sometimes I needed to sketch out what I'm building first. I did ensure to create unit tests immediately afterwards and make sure that all my code is testable. The project was created using Java on Eclipse Java EE IDE with a Gradle wrapper for running builds and tests. The unit test framework is JUnit 4. 

I chose Java because it was the best-suited language for this Kata of all the ones I am familiar with (Java, NodeJs, Perl, C). The user stories seemed to imply a strong sense of objects based on how it was written. The user stories extended and built upon the previous functionality, reminding me of inheritance. The user stories also seemed very modularized and specific in their purpose, reminding me of interfaces. Although, I am a little bit biased since the job market in my local area has a heavy lean towards Java and C#/.NET.

## Running unit tests
To run JUnit tests, you must have gradle installed.
